ðŸ”´ IMPORTANT NOTE ðŸ”´
=====================

This branch contains some fixes to support Twig 1 and PHP 8.1 in my legacy apps. I have not tested the entire framework, so there is no guarantee that it will work for you.

Twig, the flexible, fast, and secure template language for PHP
==============================================================

Twig is a template language for PHP, released under the new BSD license (code
and documentation).

Twig uses a syntax similar to the Django and Jinja template languages which
inspired the Twig runtime environment.

**Twig version 1 is not maintained anymore.**
Please, upgrade at your earliest convenience.
